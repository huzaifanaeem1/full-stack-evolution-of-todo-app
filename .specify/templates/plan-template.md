# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Spec-Driven Development Compliance
- [ ] Specification document exists and is complete in `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`
- [ ] Plan document will be created based on spec requirements
- [ ] Tasks will be generated from plan before implementation begins

### Technology Stack Verification
- [ ] Frontend will use Next.js 16+ with App Router
- [ ] Backend will use FastAPI framework
- [ ] SQLModel ORM will be used for database operations
- [ ] Neon Serverless PostgreSQL will be the database
- [ ] Better Auth will be used for JWT-based authentication
- [ ] REST API design will be followed (no GraphQL/other protocols)

### Security Requirements Check
- [ ] All API endpoints will require JWT token verification
- [ ] User ID will be extracted from JWT payload for data isolation
- [ ] Users will only access their own data/tasks
- [ ] JWT secret will be shared via environment variables only
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code

### Architecture Requirements
- [ ] Backend and frontend will be separate deployable services
- [ ] Authentication will be mandatory for all features
- [ ] Data access will be user-isolated
- [ ] Phase I (CLI) and Phase II (Web App) remain separate

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
